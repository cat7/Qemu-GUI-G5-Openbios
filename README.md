# Qemu-system-ppc Mac99 openbios GUI

A portable launcher for the OpenBIOS `mac99` machine of the
`smp-audio-usb` branch of `qemu-system-ppc` (github.com/cat7/qemu).
OpenBIOS ships with it; no Apple ROM needed. The program must sit in the
same folder as `qemu-system-ppc` (and `qemu-img`, `pc-bios/`).

## Requirements

- To run from source: Python 3.11+ with tkinter, plus `pyftpdlib` for the
  shared folder (`python -m pip install pyftpdlib`).
- To build a distributable bundle: PyInstaller, with `pyftpdlib` installed
  in the same Python.

## Run from source

    python g5_gui.py

## Shared folder

Each machine can share one host folder over FTP while it runs. With the
default (slirp) network the Mac reaches it at `ftp://10.0.2.2/` (`:2121`
when port 21 is taken); with vmnet choose "All interfaces", set a
password, and use the host's own address.

## Build on macOS

Needs a universal2 python.org framework build of Python (Homebrew's Python
is arch-specific and has no tkinter; Apple's `/usr/bin/python3` is arm64e
and not redistributable):

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13 \
        -m PyInstaller --noconfirm G5GUI.spec

Result: `dist/Qemu-system-ppc Mac99 openbios GUI.app`. Put it in the
distribution folder that holds `qemu-system-ppc` and `pc-bios/`.

## Build on Windows

    pyinstaller --noconfirm G5GUI.spec

`G5GUI.spec` targets `universal2` only on macOS; on Windows it produces
a single windowed executable, `dist/Qemu-system-ppc Mac99 openbios GUI.exe`.
Put it alongside `qemu-system-ppc.exe`.

## Tests

    python -m unittest discover -s tests
